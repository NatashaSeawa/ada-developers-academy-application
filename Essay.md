**1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?**

My exposure to programming began at a fairly young age, when I discovered that I could use a hex editor to alter the makeup of dogs and cats in the classic PC game, “Petz.” While this provided countless hours of entertainment and allowed me to develop some impressive self-taught computer skills before the age of 11, in this subculture of Petz hexers I found a community of like-minded, primarily female, “coders.” I often wonder what happened to the women who I collaborated with on Angelfire websites, or shared debugging tips with, or stayed up late into the night talking about families and feelings. 


That curiosity for technology and my passion for community building followed me through my high school and college years, where I pursued journalism and environmental studies. I taught myself GIS as a way to digitally visualize disparities between school bus routes and low-income children for a thesis project, and I took a class in R so that I could better understand how statistics are applied to the environmental and ecological fields. Later, I would teach myself basic HTML in order to manipulate email templates for marketing campaigns, and I’m forever a lifelong learner and lover of Excel.


As program manager, I often work across teams. I have learned that no matter the project, it is in the thick of our engineering team where I feel most at home. I relate to their working style, I am attracted to the logic challenges they face, and I long to be working with them, rather than alongside of them.


I have sat down with a number of female engineers who I’m lucky to call friends, and have sought their advice and heard their stories. I laid out a plan to teach myself the basics, and have followed through with that plan. That has included the HTML5 and CSS portions of FreeCodeCamp (a fantastic resource!), working through tutorials at codeschool.com, watching Lynda.com “Programming Foundations Video,” increasing my typing speed on typingclub.com, refining my use of shortcuts, and reading through Ada Developers Academy Jumpstart Program.


I am interested in taking the next step in my understanding of programming and computer science, both as a way to better understand the world we live in, and because I have spent the last few years of my career desperate for a new toolkit to tackle some of the most important problems in the environmental and social justice fields. 

**2. If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years?**

In five years, I see myself in a software engineering position with an organization or team that is working to address environmental and social injustices. This could play out in many ways, and I am open to the possibilities. 


I have a particular interest in data visualization as a way to communicate issues. I am also interested in technology solutions that can help to accomplish triple bottom lines in  public sector projects. Take, for example, the field I have been working in most recently: Green Stormwater Infrastructure (GSI). GSI projects provide a unique opportunity to link multiple community benefits: managing stormwater while enhancing natural areas, building social capital, and showcasing equitable, sustainable planning. But they must be examined at a City-Wide level to plan holistically, and while that data exists, there lacks an adequate way to collect, manage and share that information. 


If I am accepted into Ada Developers Academy, my hope would be that I could access the skills needed to join a team that is tackling these complex public, social and environmental health challenges. I also see myself pursuing an active advocate role in the effort to promote equity and embrace inclusivity and diversity in the world of tech. 

**3. After reading Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community? http://adadevelopersacademy.org/program**

I currently work in the public sector, for a utility that is funded by ratepayers. Our ratepayers come from all walks of life, all languages, all cultural groups and all income levels. I made a commitment when I entered a public service position to examine whether the services we provide as a utility exemplify ‘service equity’ and whether the programs I manage examine potential social and environmental injustices. I have been involved in processes that operationalize equity, such as applying the City’s Racial Equity Toolkit to programs and communication materials. And I have worked extensively on public outreach campaigns that seek inclusivity and equitable engagement opportunities. I actively seek to understand my implicit bias and engage in conversations about how this influences the lens through which I view the world. I did not grow up with this awareness, but it’s something I’ve taken responsibility for in recent years. 


What I can offer to Ada Developer’s Academy is a sensitivity to issues of race, gender and social justice. I will celebrate the incredible diversity that Ada Developer’s Academy has worked so hard to foster, and create a safe space for my fellow cohort members. I will take this opportunity with great seriousness. As a white, cis, college-educated applicant for a tuition-free program, I am sensitive to the fact that I could be filling a space in the Program that might have otherwise been offered to a less privileged individual. I believe that for this reason, this is an especially important question. I will advocate for inclusivity in my future internships and workplaces, and will work to break down barriers for those who have been traditionally unrepresented in the tech field. 


**4. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?**

Buried in my Resume, you’ll see that I once worked as a Project Manager for a branding company here in Seattle. We worked with a number of international brands, which often meant I was managing clients and teams who lived abroad. I had been assigned to oversee the launch of a new website for a large, well-known Brand. My primary responsibility in the weeks leading up to launch was the content and translation of the new website in 5 languages: German, Japanese, Spanish, English and French. This also meant hand-selecting the language translators. 

In my selection of contractors, I neglected to consider the fact that the French translator I had chosen was actually French-Canadian. This is how that oversight panned out for me:

When the website launched, the first screen you saw had a large “ENTER” button. However, for the French site, the word the translator had chosen roughly translated in France-French to …“PENETRATE”. [I should note that this Brand is based out of France, with the majority of its employees living in Paris.]

Needless to say, I received the whole gamut of emails from my colleagues: from laughter to disappointment and anger.

It can be so tempting to catalog how other people’s actions might have led to your mistake (“I was forced to work on an unreasonable deadline, so had to pick the first translator I could find”, “The French employees had seen the test server site; why didn’t they say something?” etc.) But in the end, the error was ultimately an important oversight on my end. And when I took responsibility for it, though my ego took a temporary blow, my relationships and respect from my colleagues did not. 

I also reminded myself that this was my first time managing a translation project of this size, and worked hard to hold a space for forgiveness for myself so that I wouldn’t fear another project of this caliber in the future. I spent a good chunk of time after that error working with a French-French translator to review and update the existing translations, and I truly believe the translations were stronger because of that secondary check. I also got an invite to Paris to meet the engineers, because they just /had/ to meet “the PENETRATE” girl.” It was a valuable learning experience, and one that — thankfully — I can laugh about now.
